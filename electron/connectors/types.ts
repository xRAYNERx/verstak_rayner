/**
 * Connectors framework — pluggable adapters for external systems.
 *
 * A connector is a named service that lives outside the project filesystem
 * (a SaaS API, an internal database, a vendor system like 1C). The AI can
 * `list_connectors`, `connector_query` over them inside the conversation;
 * the user manages credentials and which connectors are enabled in Settings.
 *
 * Design notes:
 * - Credentials never leave the main process. Adapters get a `getSecret`
 *   callback so they can fetch their auth material on demand.
 * - All network IO goes through Node's fetch with a strict timeout.
 * - Responses are size-capped before being returned to the AI to avoid
 *   blowing the context window.
 * - The secret scanner is applied to every response before it leaves the
 *   adapter — even adapters can't accidentally leak a token.
